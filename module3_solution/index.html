                         They are delicious, they are easy and they are your saviors in the times of deep hunger and low bank of ingredients and will to cook. We are talking about the good old sandwich, you can make it as simple as you want or get creative and spruce it up with the most exotic ingredients in town. A sandwich will never disappoint, and satiate you to the core of your heart. Paul Lynde remarked correctly, 'Sandwiches are wonderful. You don't need a spoon or a plate!' And we cant agree more. 
Elaborate or simple, stuffed or layered, grilled or toasted, we love sandwiches! They're easy to make, easy to eat and always filling. Don't know what to do with that sudden snack attack? Create a wholesome sandwich that won't leave you hungry. If you're short on time, look no further. Fix yourself a quick meal on-the-go.

The first record of making a sandwich dates back to the 1st century BC where the famous rabbi, Hillel the Elder is known to have started the Passover custom of sandwiching a mix of chopped nuts, apples, spices, herbs and wine between flat, unleavened bread slices.Later, during the Middle Ages in Europe, stale slices of bread were used as plates and were called trenches. This probably gave birth to the European-style sandwiches and bread also became a staple across Mediterranean countries. Elsewhere in United States, sandwiches became popular as a solo supper meal.

The sandwich was actually named after John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, a British statesman. He often ordered his valet to fetch him meat tucked between two pieces of bread. It is believed that he was fond of such a preparation due to the ease with which he could eat it while playing his game of cards.

                            If you’ve been following the blog for a while, you know that I love soup recipes. Actually, that’s an understatement. I simply adore soup.
